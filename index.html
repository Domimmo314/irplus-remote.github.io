    <div class="contentDiv">
        <span class="contentHeader">What is it?</span>
        Irplus is a free application for the Android Operating System which aims to reproduce infrared signals of various remote
        controls exactly as they are sent from the original remote. This is achieved by supporting widely-known representation
        formats for infrared codes like LIRC, PRONTO, RAW or proprietary formats found in some specification of manufacturers.
        Furthermore each layout of a remote-set can be customized with nearly endless possibilities via importable and exportable
        XML files. Codesets for remote controls can be gathered by following the guide i have provided under the "New codes"
        section. Irplus comes with minimal permissions required.
        <br>
        <span class="contentHeader">What is it not?</span>
        It is not a commercial application which tries to "obfuscate" infrared related things from the end-user for providing a dead-simple
        to use preset for every device. That would be impossible to do for a single person like me and is not the aim of
        this app. All codes are gathered via freely available code information from the internet, gathered by myself using
        remotes or contacting manufacturers who were cooperative enough to provide their codes.

        <span class="contentHeader">How to find codes?</span>
        The first attempts to find new codes should be done via a good old internet research. Often someone in this big world probably
        already provided codes, or even the manufacturer did. Just use "modelname + discrete infrared codes" in your favorite
        search engine.
        <br> Common Google Searches to find codes (May need to disable pop up blocker)
        <br> Enter model number of remote or device:

        <span class="contentHeader">Want to read codes from a remote?</span>
        Some Smartphones can record codes (HTC M7,M8,M9+, LG G3, G4). In that case you can use irplus to record the codes.

        You can build it yourself by using the following components. Often you can gather these components from old devices like
        SAT-receivers and DVD-Players. Note: This will _NOT_ work with USB-to-COM / RS232 Adapters like Prolific!

        Soldering: GND = Pin 5; RTS = Pin 7; DCD = Pin 1; Note: The connector is showing the connector part. When you are soldering
        consider that the pins on the back part are on the other side, So for instance Pin 1 is the upper left-most one.

        <span class="contentHeader">Software to read codes</span>

        To read the codes I recommend to use either
        <a href="http://www.lirc.org" target="_blank">lirc</a> (Linux) or
        <a href="http://winlirc.sourceforge.net" target="_blank">winlirc</a> (Windows). Here you will see the procedure with WinLIRC, but Lirc/Linux one should be very similar.

        <br> Use irgraph.exe to test your receiver. A typical infrared code should look like on this picture - It might be wider
        or lower, but still you should see some bars.

        <br>
        <img src="images/irgraph.png"></img>


        <br> Use lirc / winlirc to create a configuration file for your remote control. There are two ways of creating this configuration
        file: "raw" and "default". It should be first tried to create the config with "default" and if this fails a second
        attempt using "raw" should be considered.
        <br> Example command for default mode:
        <br>
        <span class="bashCmd">irrecord -d plugins\SerialDevice.dll mydevice.cf</span>
        <br> Example command for raw mode:
        <br>
        <span class="bashCmd">irrecord -f -d plugins\SerialDevice.dll mydevice.cf</span>
        <br> The result of a lirc configuration might look like this:
        <br>
        <span class="bashCmd">bits 16
            <br>flags SPACE_ENC|CONST_LENGTH

        <br> Congratulations! You have successfully read the codes of your remote!
        <br> Advanced Information: One / Zero / Header determines how many time passes during your remote does to represent a
        logical state. Example: If we could see the remote’s infrared light we would see a “1” represented by 679µs of ir-light
        and following 1581µs of no-light. A “0” would be represented by 679µs of ir-light and 452µs of silence. Bits determines
        how many 0 or 1 are possible for this format - in this case (Mute-code) 16-bits (4-Bytes) 00010000 11101111 01101000
        10010111. The third and fourth byte are only repeat-sequences where each bit is inverted.

        <span class="contentHeader">Import the lirc configuration in irplus</span>
        You can either directly import the lirc file in irplus or create a customized XML layout. Read more about the layout in the

        <br> Warning: Be careful when connecting the IR-receiver make sure you are using the correct pins, as they might be different
        compared to my picture. Some receivers have a different pinout! Take extra care when connecting the VCC (Voltage)
        pin. First try with 3.3V, if your receiver works only at very near distance try 5V and check if its getting too hot.

        This is the new guide which you can follow if you have a brand new Raspberry Pi with Raspbian 3.18.x firmware insatlled.
        It's really easy and the recommended way.
        <br> Attach the IR-Receiver to the GPIO18 (PIN12) pin, to 3.3V (PIN1), if unreliable try 5V (PIN2), and any GND (e.g.
        PIN 14) The pin-out varies by IR-Receiver, read the documentation or datasheet of your receiver.

        Many preset remote controls in irplus have a very simple layout, as i did not have the time to search a picture of the original
        remote control and modify the layout to resemble it. However YOU can do something about it by following this guideline
        :-)
        <br>
        <span class="contentHeader">1. via App interface</span>

            webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen"></iframe>

        <br> You can do basic edits inside the app. See the video below for some inspiration.
        <br>
        <span class="contentHeader">2. via XML</span>
        Each irplus remote control can be edited to fit your requirements. You can import and export irplus files within the app,
        but you may also create a totally new one and import it via file or even via an URL. The files will export als *.irplus
        files, which contains the layout and the codes in XML notation. They can be edited with any text editor on any operating
        system.

        You may use the full Unicode (UTF-8) set for naming your buttons. In addition to this you can use font-awesone icons to specify
        buttons. To choose an icon use the unicode identifier. Here: "f050". For a full list of font-awesome icons see here.To
        get the unicode identifier for an icon, click on it and search for 'Unicode'.


        <pre><code>
                &lt;button label="&amp;#xf050;" labelColor="FF000000" labelSize="25" backgroundColor="FFFFFFFF" span="3"&gt;0010101001001100000000101000&lt;/button&gt;
                            </code></pre> You may also use Unicode Emojis but these may not be available on all Android devices. But 4.4/5.x+ should have
        them. See this url for reference and copy+paste them into the label attribute
        <a href="http://getemoji.com/" target="_blank">http://getemoji.com/</a>.

        <pre><code>
                &lt;button label="🛂" labelColor="FF000000" labelSize="25" backgroundColor="FFFFFFFF" span="3"&gt;0010101001001100000000101000&lt;/button&gt;

        Here you will find a table with commonly used colors and their hex code to put on an irplus button. The format is AARRGGBB.
        (A=Alpha, R=Red, G=Green, B=Blue). Use them for labelColor and backgroundColor. Use contrasts to make the buttons
        more visible.

        Each layout consists of columns and rows. The column value is to be seen more like a grid column. A button may span multiple
        colums, so we can have each line have a different amount of buttons. To achieve this adhere to the following table

        <span class="contentHeader">Infrared?</span>
        If you ask yourself what infrared is and how a remote control like the one which came with your TV works - this is the page
        to read. Of course i will not cover everything but it will give you a quick glimpse. If you want to know more about
        infrared itself you might want to check out the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared" target="_blank">wikipedia article</a>

        <span class="contentHeader">0110100100101</span>
        Binary - this is how everything in our digital home's work. This is by far the easiest method of transmitting information
        in a machine-readable way, so when the remote controls became ubiquitous most manufacturers decided to send binary
        codes encoded in infrared light to cover all their device's functions. Initially remotes had very simple codes which
        grew complex while years passed to avoid interference with other devices like it was common in early days.

        <span class="contentHeader">So how does such a signal look like if eyes could see it?</span>

        <img src="images/irmaster.png" alt="Infrared-Pattern">

        <br> As you can see in the picture the signal sent by an infrared remote is a very fast one - So fast that the length
        of a bit is usually given in µs (microseconds). 1µs = 0.000001s. Each 1 or 0 bit is represented by a different pattern.
        This pattern is dependent on the format used, but the idea is always the same. You can make infrared light visible
        by using a camera. Unlike the human eye they are responsive to infra-red light.

        It is possible to IR signals via the audio port. It does this by modulating the data onto a sine which is half the carrier
        frequency (38 kHz is the default if the remote doesn't have a frequency specified). After rectification the sine
        becomes a full frequency carrier. The wave is inverted on the right channel, so the left and right channels can be
        used to double the voltage.

        <span class="contentHeader">Build the IR blaster</span>
        Depending on the voltage power of your phone you might need to build an active (with battery) or passive IR blaster. I recommend
        to get IR-LEDs with the lowest Uf voltage possible and test with an 1.2V power source (e.g. 1.2V rechargable battery)
        if they are bright enough.

        <br>Warning: Please try to check the wiring multiple times before attaching this to a smartphone. Shorting and/or overloading
        may damage the phone's audio jack. Also I'm not responsible for any damaged caused by using this method. Try at your
        own risk.

        <br>I have tested with a passive blaster with a very simple circuit. 2 IR-LEDs connected with each other. The diagram
        is an adapted version of the lirc.org diagram with the resistance removed.

        <br>

        <img src="images/audio_transmitter.png" alt="Audio transmitter">

        <br>This is a photo of my solution using a 'B-Speech Rx2' Bluetooth Stereo receiver. I can position this device with
        the self-made blaster connected near the devices i want to control and be able to send IR commands even without direct
        line of sight from the phone. Actually this is even better than using the integrated IR-blaster!

        <br> Note: This can work with almost any Stereo A2DP Bluetooth Stereo receiver, but it needs to have a high voltage /
        peak out.

        <br>
        <img src="images/audio_a2dp.png" alt="Audio A2DP transmitter">

        <span class="contentHeader">How to enable</span>
        I have ported this method to Android so you can use the Audio-Port or a Bluetooth A2DP Stereo receiver (Mono will probably
        not work due to low voltage) to send IR-codes on any phone. To enable this feature select "Audio Infrared Encoder"
        from the App's settings, and make sure the Volume rocker for Media is at 100%. If you want to use Bluetooth/A2DP
        make sure you are connected to the stereo receiver.

        irplus LAN This is a spin-off app of the original for sending custom infrared codes via a WiFi or Bluetooth. It has all
        the same features, but instead of using the IR-blaster it will send the IR-sequence over network (via plain HTTP) to a server which
        will do the job of processing and sending them as IR-light. Sounds cool? So you can make use of the app even when
        using a phone without IR-blaster. Although there is a small catch. You need to setup a server to process the signal.
        The process will be described here.
        <span class="contentHeader">Prepare the hardware</span>
        First you'll need a server obviously. For the sake of simplicity
        this guide will be described using a Raspberry Pi 2, as it offers a GPIO port which does the job without complex
        circuits. However you can try to setup the server on other platforms as well. Hardware IR transmitter (LED). Note
        the electric current of the LED I<sub>f</sub> in <i>A</i>. This is needed to calculate a proper R. Resistor for avoiding to fry the IR-LED. Apply the formula
        R = <sup>U</sup>/<sub>I</sub> to calculate it. Some cables to connect it to the GPIO. If you use a standard PC you should use a Serial IR transmitter circuit.
        <span class="contentHeader">Software requirements</span>
        This may vary and can be modified to
        personal preference. In this section i'll be covering the setup for the Raspberry Pi Software A Linux based operating
        system. I've been using OSMC, as i use the Raspberry Pi mostly with this OS attached to my TV. So it's also at the
        perfect position to send IR.

        This environment will be used
        to create the web-server the commands will be sent to and also to send the IR. On many distributions you'll find
        it already there if not just install the python package with the package manager. (apt-get install python). Basically
        this can be done in other programming languages as well, but i'll provide the code for Python, as i thought it was
        the easiest way to do it. If you like to contribute, i'd be happy to include tutorials for other programming languages as well.
        <span class="contentHeader">Start the server</span>
