    Transmitting IR signals via Bluetooth to be sent by external IR hardware (irplus LAN)
</p>

<p>irplus LAN This is a spin-off app of the original for sending custom infrared codes via a WiFi or Bluetooth. It has all the
    same features, but instead of using the IR-blaster it will send the IR-sequence over network (via plain HTTP) to a server
    which will do the job of processing and sending them as IR-light. Sounds cool? So you can make use of the app even when
    using a phone without IR-blaster. Although there is a small catch. You need to setup a server to process the signal.
    The process will be described here.</p>

    Prepare the hardware
</p>
<p>For this guide we will use an Arduino Uno with a Bluetooth HC-05 serial module. The infrared LED with a Resistor on it's
    voltage pin will be attached to a PWM pin (3 as default) and GND.

<p>
    <a href="scripts/irplusarduino.ino" target="_blank">Download the C (*.ino) sketch for Arduino</a>
    <br> 1. Upload the script to your Arduino
    <br> 2. Pair your Android with the HC-05 Bluetooth module (Password: 1234). Note the HC-05 should be in 9600 baud default
    mode.
    <br> 3. Now start/restart irplusLAN and select the HC-05 Bluetooth module in the App's settings.
    <br> 4. If you press a button on irplusLAN the app will transmit the signal to Arduino via Bluetooth and Arduino will send
    the IR signal.</p>
