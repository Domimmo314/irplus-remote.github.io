<h2 class="content-subhead">irplus LAN</h2>
<p>This is a spin-off app of the original for sending custom infrared codes via a network (LAN/WLAN). It has all the same features, but instead of using the IR-blaster it will send the IR-sequence over network to a server which will do the job of processing and sending them as IR-light.</p>

<p>Sounds cool? So you can make use of the app even when using a phone without IR-blaster. Although there is a small catch. You need to setup a server to process the signal. The process will be described here.</p>

<h2 class="content-subhead">Prepare the hardware</h2>

<p>First you'll need a server obviously. For the sake of simplicity this guide will be described using a Raspberry Pi 2, as it offers a GPIO port which does the job without complex circuits. However you can try to setup the server on other platforms as well.</p>

<h2 class="content-subhead">Software requirements</h2>

<p>This may vary and can be modified to personal preference. In this table i'll be covering the setup for the Raspberry Pi</p>

		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>A Linux based operating system. I've been using <a href="https://osmc.tv/" target="_blank">OSMC</a>, as i use the Raspberry Pi mostly with this OS attached to my TV. So it's also at the perfect position to send IR.</td>

On many distributions you'll find it already there if not just install the python package with the package manager. (apt-get install python). Basically this can be done in other programming languages as well, but i'll provide the code for Python, as i thought it was the easiest way to do it.</td>

<h2 class="content-subhead">Start the server</h2>

<p>After fulfilling the requiremets you can download the server script and start it. Please make sure to modify the listed variables to match your hardware.</p>
<table class="pure-table">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Variables</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>The GPIO Port where the IR-LED is connected to. I'll be using GPIO 17. Make sure you're using a 3.3V Pin! Modify this line accordingly: tx = GPIOIRTransmission(pi, <span style="color: red;">17</span>, query_carrier[0])</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>The network interface and port. Basically, just make sure your server is not accessible from outside your local LAN. And setup firewall properly if you don't want other to change your TV channels ;-): server = HTTPServer(('0.0.0.0', 8080), GetHandler)</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
	
	<p><a href="../python/irplus.py" target="_blank" download>Download the Python Server Script</a></p>

	<p>Start the server by calling 'nohup python irplus.py &'</p>
	
	<p>If you want to kill it call this in your browser 'http://192.168.1.104:8080?command=kill' (Adapt to your IP and Port)</p>


<h2 class="content-subhead">Setup in the App</h2>

<p>To setup enter the URL with the port into the App Setting. (Router icon)</p>

<h2 class="content-subhead">Specification of request</h2>

<p>The requests for IR-signals are made up like this and can be sent from other applications or the web-browser as well if you have the raw IR code.</p>

<p>http://192.168.1.104:8080/?carrier=38000&code=9000+4500+1200+600</p>
	
<h2 class="content-subhead">Room for improvement</h2>

<p>Find a way to send modulated IR signals without using a native C library. Probably will be hard...</p>
<p>Update the server code to Python3</p>
<p>Provide alternative means to process the requests. E.g. Nodejs, Java etc.</p>
