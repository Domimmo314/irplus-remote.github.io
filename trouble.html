               Make sure your phone has a compatible infrared blaster (an IR LED) - without this it can't work! (Or use the Do-it-yourself blaster explained in the section 'No IR port'.

               Try the available codes for a specific manufacturer, even if your device is not listed the chance to make it work is high, since the codes are the same most of the times. 
               For some manufacturers i have added the model numbers of the remotes and not the devices. An example for this is Samsung. Here each remote has codes starting with AA, AH, BN etc. check yours and start from there...

               Some mobile phone covers, cases, bumpers etc. may cover the IR LED (its usually at the top, like on remote controls) - make sure it is in line-of-sight to the device you want to control

               The IR receiver of the device you want to control must not be covered, even glass can be an issue with some phones (unlike the real remote, which has much higher LED power, since they can use bigger LEDs here.

               Try to change the frequency and repeat values (reasonable values are 1 to 4) via 'Edit'. Some devices may need a special frequency. Most common frequencies are 36000Hz, 38000Hz, 40000Hz. You can also try some values in between, to optimize reception.
