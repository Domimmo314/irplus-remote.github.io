  irplus - highly customizable infrared protocol app
</p>

<p>Irplus is a free application for the Android Operating System which aims to reproduce infrared signals of various remote
  controls exactly as they are sent from the original remote. This is achieved by supporting widely-known representation
  formats for infrared codes like Lirc, Pronto or proprietary formats found in some specification of manufacturers.
  Furthermore each layout of a remote-set can be customized with nearly endless possibilities via importable and exportable
  XML files. New IR codes can be added by following the guide i have provided under the "Codes" section.
  Irplus comes with minimal permissions required. Irplus does not try to "obfuscate" infrared related things from the end-user for providing a dead-simple
      to use preset for every device. That would be impossible to do for a single person like me and is not the aim of this app.
      All codes are gathered via freely available code information from the internet, gathered by myself using remotes or contacting
      manufacturers who were cooperative enough to provide their codes. </p>
