    <h2 class="content-subhead">What is it?</h2>
       <p>
          Irplus is a free application for the Android Operating System which aims to reproduce infrared signals of various remote controls exactly as they are sent from the original remote. This is achieved by supporting widely-known representation formats for infrared codes like LIRC, PRONTO, RAW or proprietary formats found in some specification of manufacturers. Furthermore each layout of a remote-set can be customized with nearly endless possibilities via importable and exportable XML files. Codesets for remote controls can be gathered by following the guide i have provided under the "New codes" section. Irplus comes with minimal permissions required.

    <h2 class="content-subhead">What is it not?</h2>
       <p>
          It is not a commercial application which tries to "obfuscate" infrared related things from the end-user for providing a dead-simple to use preset for every device. That would be impossible to do for a single person like me and is not the aim of this app. All codes are gathered via freely available code information from the internet, gathered by myself using remotes or contacting manufacturers who were cooperative enough to provide their codes.
